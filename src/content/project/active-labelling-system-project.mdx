In addition to achieving high accuracy on unseen data, the active labeling system using CNN is highly efficient and can significantly reduce the time and effort required for manual labeling. By allowing the user to quickly identify and label incorrect images, the system can continuously learn and improve its performance over time

Advantage of the active labeling system is its ability to adapt to changing data distribution and concepts. As the data changes and new patterns emerge, the system can learn and adjust its labeling criteria to ensure that the labeled data remains accurate and relevant.

Furthermore, the system's user-friendly interface and ease of use make it accessible to a wide range of users with varying levels of technical expertise

Overall, the active labeling system using CNN is a powerful tool for data labeling and machine learning that can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of data processing pipelines. Its flexibility, adaptability, and user-friendliness make it a valuable asset for businesses and organizations looking to leverage machine learning for a wide range of applications.
